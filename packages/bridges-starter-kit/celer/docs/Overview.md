# Overview
This module contains scripts to help you interact / integrate cBridge into your applications robustly
without explicitly digging into cBridge technical documentation or scratching your head ;)

# What is a cBridge
Celer Bridge (cBridge) as its name shows is a cryptocurrency cross-chain bridge that helps in moving your assets from one chain to the other with lower costs.
Want to learn more about cBridge ? [This](https://cbridge-docs.celer.network) should help you in your quest.

# What can I do with this module?
If you're a fan of thanos and looking for an _infinity stone_ to roll out cBridge support in your application
with just one snap! you're at right place :) 
![img.jpg](img/img.jpg)

Let me tell you what will happen after thanos snap

## 1. PoolBased Transfer
You will be able to transfer your assets using cBridge's `pool based transfer`
method. It's a liquidity based transfer in which your assets are locked at source_chain (sending chain) and released on
destination_chain (receiving chain) from a pool of liquidity available on the destination chain.
Thanos snap ðŸ«° for this is: 
```
import { poolTransfer } from "@klaytn/kss-bridges-celer"

poolTransfer(transferObj)
```

#### Parameters
`Object` - `transferObj`
  * `CBRIDGE_GATEWAY_URL` - `string` From [here](https://cbridge-docs.celer.network/developer/cbridge-sdk#cbridge-testnet-endpoint) you can get Testnet & Mainnet cBridge's Gateway URLs.
  * `WALLET_ADDRESS` - `string` public key of your wallet / account
  * `PRIVATE_KEY` - `string` private key of your wallet / account
  * `SRC_CHAIN_ID` - `number` chain ID of source-chain. From [here](https://chainlist.org) you can get the chain ID of your source-chain
  * `DST_CHAIN_ID` - `number` chain ID of destination-chain. From [here](https://chainlist.org) you can get the chain ID of your source-chain
  * `SRC_CHAIN_RPC` - `string` RPC endpoint of your source-chain (the chain from where you want to send your tokens to other chain)
  * `TOKEN_SYMBOL` - `string` SYMBOL of your token, which you want to move from source chain to destination.
You can get SYMBOLS of supported tokens with the pair of chains you've mentioned above at [cBridge](https://test-cbridge-v2.celer.network/5/71401/USDC) web interface
  * `AMOUNT` - `string` `amount` of token, you want to move from source to destination chain Ex: 1 USDC
  * `SLIPPAGE_TOLERANCE` - `number` slippage amount you can tolerate while transferring your tokens from source to destination chain. Please go through [celer slippage_tolerance](https://cbridge-docs.celer.network/developer/api-reference/gateway-estimateamt) for more info.
  * `CONFIRMATIONS` - `number` set the number of Blocks confirmations you want a transaction should achieve before considering it mined. Provie Max value of source and destination chain confirmations.

#### Result
Promise `transferId` - `string` Transfer ID for tracking the transaction. To track the status or refund transaction if stuck

## 3. burnCanonicalToken
You will also be able to withdraw your assets from destination chain to source chain (the chain from where you sent tokens earlier) using cBridge's `Burn Canonical Token`
method. It's a method in which your assets get burnt at source_chain ( the chain from where you're withdrawing your assets) and released on
destination_chain (the chain on which you want to receive you withdrawn assets).

  - you can get maxBurn & minBurn amount from [this Godwoken cBridge contract](https://gw-explorer.nervosdao.community/address/0x70D4814e111Ad66B90B90D54a44797BC696BcdAF/read-contract#address-tabs).
